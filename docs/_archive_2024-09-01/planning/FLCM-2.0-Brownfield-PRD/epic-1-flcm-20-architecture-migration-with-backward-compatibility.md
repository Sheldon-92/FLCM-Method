# Epic 1: FLCM 2.0 Architecture Migration with Backward Compatibility

**Epic Goal**: Establish 3-layer architecture alongside existing 4-agent system, implement core framework library, and enable controlled migration path while maintaining 100% backward compatibility for existing users.

**Integration Requirements**: All new components must coexist with legacy code, share data formats, and support gradual feature adoption through configuration flags.

## Story 1.1: Dual Architecture Foundation

As a developer,  
I want to establish parallel architecture paths,  
so that 1.0 and 2.0 can run simultaneously without conflicts.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Version router implemented to direct requests to appropriate architecture
2. Configuration system supports version selection per user
3. Shared utilities extracted and accessible to both architectures
4. Logging clearly identifies which version is processing requests
5. Health check endpoint reports status of both architectures

### Integration Verification
- IV1: All existing 1.0 CLI commands execute successfully
- IV2: Performance monitoring shows <5% overhead from router
- IV3: Memory usage remains within 10% of baseline

## Story 1.2: Document Schema Migration System

As a system administrator,  
I want automated document conversion between formats,  
so that users can seamlessly work with both versions.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Bidirectional converter between agent outputs and layer documents
2. Schema versioning system implemented for document evolution
3. Validation ensures no data loss during conversion
4. Batch conversion tool for existing user vaults
5. Real-time conversion for active sessions

### Integration Verification
- IV1: 1000+ existing documents convert without data loss
- IV2: Obsidian continues to read all document formats
- IV3: Conversion latency <100ms per document

## Story 1.3: Framework Library with Legacy Support

As a content creator,  
I want access to all existing and new frameworks,  
so that my workflow improves without losing familiar tools.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. All 1.0 frameworks (RICE, Teaching Preparation, etc.) ported to library
2. 5 new core frameworks added (SWOT-USED, SCAMPER, etc.)
3. Framework selector supports both old and new invocation methods
4. Legacy command mappings maintained for backward compatibility
5. Framework documentation includes migration guides

### Integration Verification
- IV1: Existing framework commands produce identical outputs
- IV2: New frameworks accessible through both CLI modes
- IV3: Framework performance meets <3s presentation requirement

## Story 1.4: Collaborative Dialogue with Command Fallback

As a user,  
I want to choose between new collaborative mode and familiar commands,  
so that I can adopt new features at my own pace.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Mode selector allows switching between interaction styles
2. Command mode maintains exact 1.0 behavior with deprecation notices
3. Collaborative mode provides framework-based guidance
4. Context preserved when switching between modes
5. User preference persisted across sessions

### Integration Verification
- IV1: All 1.0 command sequences execute correctly
- IV2: Mode switching preserves conversation context
- IV3: Response time remains within 1.0 benchmarks

## Story 1.5: Feature Flag Management System

As a product manager,  
I want granular control over feature rollout,  
so that we can manage risk during migration.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Feature flag system controls individual 2.0 features
2. User cohort assignment for A/B testing
3. Remote flag updates without restart
4. Automatic rollback on error threshold
5. Usage metrics tracked per feature flag

### Integration Verification
- IV1: Flags correctly route to appropriate code paths
- IV2: No performance impact when flags disabled
- IV3: Rollback completes within 30 seconds

## Story 1.6: Migration Analytics and Monitoring

As a system operator,  
I want comprehensive metrics on migration progress,  
so that we can ensure smooth transition.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Dashboard shows usage split between 1.0 and 2.0
2. Error rates tracked separately per version
3. Performance comparison metrics available
4. User satisfaction tracked for both versions
5. Automated alerts for migration issues

### Integration Verification
- IV1: Metrics accurately reflect actual usage patterns
- IV2: No metric collection overhead >2%
- IV3: Alert system triggers within 1 minute of issues
