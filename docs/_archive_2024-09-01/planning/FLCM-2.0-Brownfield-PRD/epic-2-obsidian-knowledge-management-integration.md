# Epic 2: Obsidian Knowledge Management Integration

**Epic Goal**: Implement comprehensive Obsidian integration that transforms FLCM into a learning and knowledge management system, enabling persistent insights, pattern recognition, and growth tracking through deep vault integration.

**Integration Requirements**: Seamless bidirectional sync with Obsidian vaults, automatic linking and tagging, knowledge graph visualization, and learning progress metrics.

## Story 2.1: Obsidian Plugin Foundation

As a knowledge worker,  
I want FLCM to integrate deeply with my Obsidian vault,  
so that all my insights and content become part of my permanent knowledge base.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Obsidian plugin installable via community plugins or BRAT
2. Bidirectional sync between FLCM documents and vault
3. Conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
4. Custom frontmatter for FLCM metadata
5. Settings page for sync preferences and vault location
6. Real-time sync status indicator in Obsidian

### Integration Verification
- IV1: Existing vaults remain intact during plugin installation
- IV2: Sync completes within 2 seconds for typical document
- IV3: No data loss during conflict resolution

## Story 2.2: Knowledge Graph Visualization

As a visual learner,  
I want to see connections between my insights and content,  
so that I can discover patterns and relationships in my thinking.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Graph view shows nodes for insights, content, and frameworks
2. Edge weights represent connection strength
3. Filtering by date, framework, or topic
4. Clickable nodes navigate to documents
5. Automatic clustering of related content
6. Export graph as image or interactive HTML

### Integration Verification
- IV1: Graph renders within 3 seconds for 1000+ documents
- IV2: Navigation maintains Obsidian's native behavior
- IV3: Graph updates reflect vault changes in real-time

## Story 2.3: Learning Progress Tracker

As a lifelong learner,  
I want to track my growth and understanding over time,  
so that I can see how my thinking evolves.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Dashboard showing framework usage statistics
2. Insight depth progression over time
3. Content quality metrics trending
4. Learning velocity calculations
5. Weekly/monthly progress reports
6. Exportable learning analytics

### Integration Verification
- IV1: Historical data preserved during tracking implementation
- IV2: Metrics calculation doesn't slow vault operations
- IV3: Reports generate within 5 seconds

## Story 2.4: Framework Templates and Automation

As a structured thinker,  
I want Obsidian templates for each framework,  
so that I can apply methodologies directly in my vault.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Template generated for each framework (SWOT, SCAMPER, etc.)
2. Templates include guided questions and structure
3. Auto-linking to related framework applications
4. Frontmatter tags for framework tracking
5. Quick switcher integration for framework selection
6. Bulk template application to existing notes

### Integration Verification
- IV1: Templates compatible with Obsidian's template plugin
- IV2: Auto-linking doesn't break existing links
- IV3: Frontmatter follows Obsidian standards

## Story 2.5: Semantic Linking and Pattern Recognition

As a researcher,  
I want FLCM to automatically connect related content,  
so that I can discover non-obvious relationships.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Semantic analysis identifies related documents
2. Automatic backlink suggestions
3. Pattern detection across multiple documents
4. Topic clustering and tag suggestions
5. Similarity scores for document pairs
6. Manual override for auto-connections

### Integration Verification
- IV1: Analysis completes in background without blocking
- IV2: Suggested links have >70% relevance accuracy
- IV3: Manual overrides persist across sessions

## Story 2.6: Daily Learning Summaries

As a reflective practitioner,  
I want automated summaries of my learning,  
so that I can review and consolidate my insights.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Daily note generation with learning summary
2. Key insights from the day highlighted
3. Progress metrics included
4. Links to all created content
5. Reflection prompts for deeper thinking
6. Weekly rollup summaries

### Integration Verification
- IV1: Daily notes follow user's existing format
- IV2: Summary generation happens automatically at configured time
- IV3: No duplicate summaries created
