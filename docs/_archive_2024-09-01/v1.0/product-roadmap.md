## **Conclusion**

This roadmap prioritizes delivering a functional MVP in 6 weeks that proves the core value proposition: **methodology-driven content creation that reduces time by 50%**. By leveraging BMAD's architecture and focusing on the essential Collectorâ†’Creator pipeline first, we can validate the concept quickly and iterate based on user feedback.

The phased approach allows for:
1. **Early validation** of core assumptions
2. **Incremental complexity** as we learn
3. **Risk mitigation** through staged development
4. **User feedback integration** at each phase

The key to success is maintaining focus on the MVP scope while building a foundation that supports the full vision.
