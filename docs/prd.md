# **FLCM (Friction Lab Content Maker) Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

*Version 1.0 | December 2024*

---

## **Goals and Background Context**

### **Goals**

- Deliver a functional Four-Agent content creation system where **each agent provides specific methodologies and frameworks** to guide users in developing, clarifying, and elevating their ideas
- **Establish Collector Agent methodology** for systematic information filtering and insight extraction using proven frameworks
- **Implement Scholar Agent's learning models** that transform passive consumption into active comprehension through structured techniques, including **Teaching Preparation Mode** leveraging the Prot√©g√© Effect
- **Deploy Creator Agent's voice preservation frameworks** that guide users through idea development while maintaining authentic perspective
- **Build Adapter Agent's platform optimization models** that systematically transform content for each platform's unique culture
- Enable creators to maintain authentic voice while scaling content across WeChat, XiaoHongShu, LinkedIn, and X/Twitter
- Reduce content creation time by 50% from 3-4 hours to 1.5-2 hours through **methodology-driven workflows**
- Build a persistent knowledge network through Obsidian integration where **methodological patterns compound over time**
- **Enable learning through teaching preparation**, where users deepen understanding by explaining concepts as if they will teach others
- **Create reflection loops** that capture learning insights from each content creation cycle
- **Track understanding confidence** and learning progression over time through systematic self-assessment
- Validate that **framework-guided AI collaboration** produces superior content compared to pure AI generation

### **Background Context**

FLCM addresses the Creating-Learning-Scaling Trilemma through a revolutionary approach: **methodology-embedded agents**. Unlike simple AI tools that generate content, FLCM provides structured frameworks within each agent that guide human thinking. The Collector doesn't just extract information‚Äîit uses signal-to-noise methodologies. The Scholar doesn't just explain‚Äîit employs progressive depth models and analogical reasoning frameworks. The Creator doesn't just write‚Äîit guides through proven ideation and voice preservation techniques. The Adapter doesn't just reformat‚Äîit applies platform-specific engagement models.

This methodological approach, inspired by BMAD's success in software development, ensures that users don't just get output‚Äîthey develop better thinking patterns. Each interaction strengthens the user's ability to identify insights, understand concepts, maintain voice, and optimize for platforms. The MVP implementation will validate whether these embedded methodologies can transform content creation from a task into a skill-building practice.

### **Theoretical Foundation**

FLCM is grounded in established learning science and knowledge management principles:

**Cognitive Science Research:**
- **Generation Effect** (Slamecka & Graf, 1978): Active content creation improves retention by 50% compared to passive consumption
- **Prot√©g√© Effect** (Fiorella & Mayer, 2013): Preparing to teach others deepens understanding by 28% compared to learning for oneself
- **Self-Explanation Effect** (Chi et al., 1989): Explaining concepts to oneself doubles learning outcomes
- **Retrieval Practice** (Roediger & Karpicke, 2006): Active recall beats re-reading by 50% for long-term retention

**Knowledge Management Systems:**
- **Zettelkasten Method** (Luhmann/Ahrens, 2017): Networked note-taking creates compounding knowledge returns
- **Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)**: Systematic capture and connection of ideas enhances creativity and insight
- **Dual Coding Theory** (Paivio, 1971): Information processed in multiple formats improves understanding

**Creator Best Practices:**
- **Build in Public**: Public accountability and feedback accelerate learning and iteration
- **Learn in Public** (Shawn Wang, 2018): Teaching while learning creates compound benefits
- **Working Out Loud** (Stepper, 2015): Process documentation improves outcomes and knowledge transfer

These principles are embedded throughout FLCM's agent methodologies, ensuring that content creation becomes a vehicle for deep learning rather than mere production.

## **Obsidian Integration Architecture**

### **Overview**

Obsidian serves as FLCM's knowledge persistence layer, providing bi-directional linking, knowledge graph visualization, and long-term content management. The integration uses direct file system access to create and manage markdown files within an Obsidian vault.

### **Vault Structure Design**

```

```

### **Document Frontmatter Schema**

All FLCM documents include standardized YAML frontmatter for metadata management:

```yaml
---
# FLCM Core Metadata
flcm_type: [content-brief|knowledge-synthesis|draft|reflection|published]
flcm_id: [type]-[YYYY-MM-DD]-[sequence]
agent: [collector|scholar|creator|adapter]
status: [inbox|processing|synthesized|published]
created: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS
modified: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS

# Learning Metadata
confidence_score: [1-10]
understanding_level: [beginner|intermediate|advanced|expert]
teaching_ready: [true|false]
concepts: [array of concept names]
methodologies_used: [array of methodology names]

# Content Metadata
sources: [array of source links]
related: [array of related document links]
contradicts: [array of conflicting documents]
next_steps: [array of next document links]

# Publishing Metadata
platforms: [wechat|xiaohongshu|linkedin|twitter]
publish_date: YYYY-MM-DD
performance_metrics: {}

# Tags
tags: [array of hashtags]
---
```

### **Linking Strategy**

FLCM implements automatic bi-directional linking following Obsidian conventions:

**Link Creation Rules:**
- Concepts: `[[concept/ConceptName]]` - Creates concept pages automatically
- Sources: `[[source/SourceTitle]]` - Links to source documents
- Related: `[[RelatedDocument]]` - Cross-references within workflow
- Methodologies: `[[methodology/MethodName]]` - Links to methodology documentation

**Knowledge Graph Building:**
- Every document creates nodes in the knowledge graph
- Links represent relationships (derives_from, teaches, contradicts, evolves_to)
- Automatic backlink generation for discovered connections
- Tag-based clustering for topic discovery

### **File Naming Conventions**

```
Pattern: [type]-[date]-[title-slug].md

Examples:
- content-brief-2024-12-28-ai-agents-learning.md
- knowledge-synthesis-2024-12-28-protege-effect.md
- draft-v3-2024-12-28-build-in-public.md
- reflection-2024-12-28-weekly-insights.md
```

## **Next Steps**

### **UX Expert Prompt**

"Review the FLCM PRD focusing on the document-driven workflow and agent interactions. Create a detailed UX architecture that ensures smooth transitions between agents, clear progress indicators, and intuitive methodology selection. Pay special attention to the learning curve for new users and how we can progressively reveal complexity."

### **Architect Prompt**

"Using this FLCM PRD and the BMAD architecture as foundation, create a comprehensive technical architecture document. Focus on: 1) Detailed agent communication protocols, 2) Methodology engine implementation, 3) Document pipeline with validation, 4) Obsidian integration strategy, 5) Performance optimization for 1000+ documents. Ensure the architecture supports both MVP delivery and future scaling to standalone applications."
