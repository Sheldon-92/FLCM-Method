# **User Interface Design Goals**

## **Overall UX Vision**

FLCM provides a document-driven workflow where each stage produces concrete artifacts that feed into the next stage. Users experience certainty through clear document milestones - from Content Brief to Published Pieces - with each agent owning specific document types. The interface guides users through a predictable journey where every step has a tangible output, creating a sense of control and progress.

## **Key Interaction Paradigms**

- **Document-Centric Workflow**: Each interaction produces or refines a specific document type
- **Artifact Chain**: Clear progression from Source→Brief→Draft→Adapted Versions
- **Checkpoint Documents**: Users can review, modify, and approve each document before proceeding
- **Agent Ownership**: Each agent "owns" specific document types and transforms them to the next stage
- **Version Control**: All documents maintain history for learning and improvement
