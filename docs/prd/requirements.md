# **Requirements**

## **Functional**

**FR1:** The system shall implement a Collector Agent that processes URLs, markdown files, and plain text input using signal-to-noise ratio analysis and concept extraction frameworks

**FR2:** The Collector Agent shall identify and tag concepts for knowledge network building, highlighting connections to existing knowledge base

**FR3:** The system shall implement a Scholar Agent that provides progressive depth exploration from basic to advanced understanding using structured learning methodologies

**FR4:** The Scholar Agent shall generate analogies, thought experiments, and comprehension tests to verify and deepen user understanding

**FR5:** The system shall implement a Creator Agent that maintains user's authentic voice through linguistic fingerprinting and perspective consistency frameworks

**FR6:** The Creator Agent shall guide users through 3-5 rounds of collaborative refinement using structured ideation methodologies (SPARK, PREP, etc.)

**FR7:** The system shall implement an Adapter Agent that transforms core content for WeChat, XiaoHongShu, LinkedIn, and X/Twitter using platform-specific optimization models

**FR8:** The Adapter Agent shall generate platform-appropriate hooks, structures, and calls-to-action while preserving core message integrity

**FR9:** The system shall provide Quick Mode (20-30 min) and Standard Mode (45-60 min) workflows with methodology transparency at each step

**FR10:** The system shall integrate with Obsidian for automatic content filing and knowledge network building with bi-directional links

**FR11:** The system shall support both natural language and slash commands (/collect, /scholar, /create, /adapt) for agent invocation

**FR12:** Each agent shall expose its methodological frameworks and explain its reasoning process to users

**FR13:** The Scholar Agent shall implement Teaching Preparation Mode where users explain concepts as if preparing to teach others, including generating potential student questions and simplified explanations

**FR14:** The system shall generate post-creation Reflection Documents that capture learning insights, surprises, and next exploration areas after each content creation cycle

**FR15:** The system shall track understanding confidence scores (1-10 scale) and learning progression metrics to measure knowledge development over time

## **Non Functional**

**NFR1:** Agent response time shall not exceed 3 seconds for individual operations

**NFR2:** Complete workflow from collection to multi-platform adaptation shall complete within 30 seconds of processing time

**NFR3:** The system shall maintain 80%+ reliability for all core agent functions

**NFR4:** Generated content shall require less than 20% manual editing before publication

**NFR5:** The system shall preserve user's authentic voice with consistency rating of 7+/10 across all platforms

**NFR6:** The system shall operate within Claude Code's memory and processing constraints

**NFR7:** All methodological frameworks shall be transparent and customizable through YAML configuration

**NFR8:** The system shall support content libraries of 1000+ pieces without performance degradation

**NFR9:** Platform adaptations shall follow current best practices and algorithm preferences for each platform

**NFR10:** The system shall provide clear error messages and fallback options when agent operations fail

**NFR11:** The system shall maintain compatibility with Obsidian's markdown format, including CommonMark and Obsidian-flavored extensions

**NFR12:** File system operations shall handle cross-platform path differences (Windows backslash vs Unix forward slash) transparently

**NFR13:** The system shall validate and sanitize file names to prevent file system errors and maintain Obsidian compatibility
