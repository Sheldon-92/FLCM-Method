**I want** to explore concepts at different depth levels,  
**so that** I can build understanding gradually.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: 5-level depth system implemented (ELI5 to Expert)
2: Automatic complexity assessment
3: User depth preference tracking
4: Smooth transitions between levels
5: Prerequisite concept identification
6: Depth recommendation based on prior knowledge

## **Story 4.2: Analogy and Explanation Generator**
**As a** user,  
**I want** complex concepts explained through analogies,  
**so that** I can understand through familiar references.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Domain-specific analogy database created
2: Analogy relevance scoring
3: Multiple analogy generation for same concept
4: Cultural context consideration
5: User feedback on analogy effectiveness
6: Analogy evolution based on understanding level

## **Story 4.3: Knowledge Synthesis Document Creator**
**As a** Scholar Agent,  
**I want** to create comprehensive knowledge documents,  
**so that** learning is preserved and referenceable.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Knowledge document template implemented
2: Automatic concept linking
3: Learning path visualization
4: Understanding checkpoints included
5: Related resources section
6: Knowledge graph integration

## **Story 4.4: Understanding Verification System**
**As a** user,  
**I want** to verify my understanding,  
**so that** I know when I've truly learned something.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Comprehension test generator created
2: Misconception identifier implemented
3: Self-assessment rubrics provided
4: Practical application exercises generated
5: Understanding score calculation
6: Remedial learning path suggestions

## **Story 4.5: Teaching Preparation Mode**
**As a** user,  
**I want** to explain concepts as if I'm preparing to teach others,  
**so that** I deepen my understanding through the Protégé Effect.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: "Explain to a beginner" prompt generation
2: Potential student question simulator
3: Common misconception anticipation
4: Lesson plan outline creator
5: Understanding confidence score (1-10) tracking
6: Teaching readiness assessment

## **Story 4.6: Learning Reflection System**
**As a** user,  
**I want** to reflect on what I learned after creating content,  
**so that** I can capture insights and plan future learning.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Post-creation reflection document template
2: Learning insights capture prompts
3: Surprise and discovery documentation
4: Next exploration area identification
5: Learning journey visualization
6: Progress tracking over time
