# **Epic 10: Obsidian Integration & Knowledge Graph**

**Epic Goal**: Create persistent knowledge management through Obsidian integration, building a compounding knowledge asset with proper vault structure, metadata management, and bi-directional linking.

## **Story 10.1: Vault Structure & File System Integration**
**As a** user,  
**I want** FLCM to automatically organize content in my Obsidian vault,  
**so that** my knowledge is systematically stored and easily navigable.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Implement folder structure (Inbox, Learning, Creation, Published, Knowledge-Base)
2: File naming convention enforced ([type]-[date]-[title-slug].md)
3: Automatic file placement based on document type and status
4: Path configuration for vault location
5: Cross-platform path compatibility (Windows/Mac/Linux)
6: Folder creation with proper permissions

## **Story 10.2: Frontmatter Metadata Management**
**As a** system,  
**I want** to embed rich metadata in document frontmatter,  
**so that** documents are searchable, filterable, and trackable.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: YAML frontmatter generation for all documents
2: Metadata schema validation before writing
3: Automatic timestamp management (created/modified)
4: Confidence score and understanding level tracking
5: Source and relationship linking in metadata
6: Platform-specific metadata fields

## **Story 10.3: Wiki-Link Generation & Management**
**As a** user,  
**I want** automatic bi-directional linking between related content,  
**so that** my knowledge network grows organically.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Convert internal references to [[wiki-links]]
2: Automatic concept page creation when referenced
3: Backlink generation for all references
4: Link validation to prevent broken links
5: Alias support for alternative link names
6: Link preview generation for context

## **Story 10.4: Template System Integration**
**As a** user,  
**I want** consistent document templates,  
**so that** all content follows predictable structure.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Template files in vault Templates/ folder
2: Variable substitution in templates ({{date}}, {{title}}, etc.)
3: Agent-specific template selection
4: Template versioning and updates
5: Custom template creation support
6: Default content for each document type

## **Story 10.5: Search & Retrieval Implementation**
**As a** user,  
**I want** to quickly find relevant past content,  
**so that** I can build on previous knowledge.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Integration with Obsidian search syntax
2: Metadata-based filtering (by agent, status, confidence)
3: Tag-based content discovery
4: Date range filtering
5: Full-text search within FLCM
6: Search result ranking by relevance

## **Story 10.6: Knowledge Graph Visualization Support**
**As a** user,  
**I want** to see connections between my content,  
**so that** I can discover patterns and gaps.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Proper node creation for graph view
2: Meaningful link types (derives_from, contradicts, teaches)
3: Tag-based node coloring support
4: Cluster identification through common tags
5: Orphan document detection
6: Graph metrics export (connectivity, centrality)
