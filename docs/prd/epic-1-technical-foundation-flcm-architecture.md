# **Epic 1: Technical Foundation & FLCM Architecture**

**Epic Goal**: Establish the complete FLCM infrastructure with a solid foundation for all agents and workflows while delivering a working prototype of basic content collection.

## **Story 1.1: Repository Structure Setup**
**As a** developer,  
**I want** to create the FLCM directory structure with clear organization,  
**so that** the project has a clear, maintainable organization.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: `.flcm-core/` directory created with all required subdirectories
2: Directory structure optimized for content creation workflow
3: README files in each directory explaining purpose
4: `.gitignore` configured for FLCM-specific files
5: Directory permissions set correctly for Claude Code access

## **Story 1.2: Configuration System Implementation**
**As a** user,  
**I want** a YAML-based configuration system,  
**so that** I can customize FLCM behavior without code changes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: `core-config.yaml` created with all configuration options
2: Configuration schema documented
3: Default values set for all options
4: Configuration validation on load
5: User preferences override system defaults
6: Configuration hot-reload supported

## **Story 1.3: Claude Code Command Integration**
**As a** user,  
**I want** to interact with FLCM through Claude Code commands,  
**so that** I have a seamless workflow experience.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: `/flcm` command namespace registered
2: Basic commands implemented (init, help, status)
3: Command autocomplete configured
4: Error messages helpful and actionable
5: Command history tracked
6: Command aliases supported

## **Story 1.4: Base Agent Framework**
**As a** developer,  
**I want** a reusable agent framework,  
**so that** all agents follow consistent patterns.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Base agent class/interface defined
2: Agent lifecycle methods implemented (init, execute, cleanup)
3: Agent communication protocol established
4: Agent state management implemented
5: Agent error handling standardized
6: Agent performance monitoring added

## **Story 1.5: Document Pipeline Architecture**
**As a** system,  
**I want** a robust document processing pipeline,  
**so that** content flows smoothly between agents.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Document schema definitions created
2: Document validation framework implemented
3: Document transformation utilities built
4: Document versioning system established
5: Document metadata management added
6: Document storage abstraction layer created
