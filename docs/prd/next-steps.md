# **Next Steps**

## **UX Expert Prompt**

"Review the FLCM PRD focusing on the document-driven workflow and agent interactions. Create a detailed UX architecture that ensures smooth transitions between agents, clear progress indicators, and intuitive methodology selection. Pay special attention to the learning curve for new users and how we can progressively reveal complexity."

## **Architect Prompt**

"Using this FLCM PRD and the BMAD architecture as foundation, create a comprehensive technical architecture document. Focus on: 1) Detailed agent communication protocols, 2) Methodology engine implementation, 3) Document pipeline with validation, 4) Obsidian integration strategy, 5) Performance optimization for 1000+ documents. Ensure the architecture supports both MVP delivery and future scaling to standalone applications."
