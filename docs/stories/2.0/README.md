# FLCM 2.0 User Stories

## Overview
These user stories define the implementation of FLCM 2.0 based on the [FLCM-2.0-PRD.md](../../FLCM-2.0-PRD.md). The stories are organized into 5 phases to be completed over 8 days.

- [Story 4.3: Performance Optimization](4.3-performance-optimization.md)
- [Story 4.4: Error Handling & Recovery](4.4-error-handling-recovery.md)
- [Story 4.5: User Acceptance Testing](4.5-user-acceptance-testing.md)

### Phase 5: Documentation & Deployment (Day 8)
- [Story 5.1: User Documentation](5.1-user-documentation.md)
- [Story 5.2: Developer Documentation](5.2-developer-documentation.md)
- [Story 5.3: Installation Package](5.3-installation-package.md)
- [Story 5.4: Release Package](5.4-release-package.md)
- [Story 5.5: Deployment & Monitoring](5.5-deployment-monitoring.md)

## Story Format

Each story follows the standard format:
- **User Story**: As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Measurable requirements for completion
- **Tasks**: Technical implementation steps
- **Sub-stories**: Breakdown for complex features

## Priority Guidelines

### Must Have (P0)
- Core agent implementations (Scholar, Creator, Publisher)
- Basic Claude commands
- Document flow pipeline
- Essential error handling

### Should Have (P1)
- All 5 frameworks in Scholar
- All 3 modes in Creator
- All 4 platforms in Publisher
- Performance optimization

### Nice to Have (P2)
- Advanced monitoring
- Extended documentation
- Additional platforms

## Definition of Done

A story is considered complete when:
1. ✅ All acceptance criteria met
2. ✅ Unit tests written and passing (>80% coverage)
3. ✅ Integration tests passing
4. ✅ Code reviewed and approved
5. ✅ Documentation updated
6. ✅ No critical bugs remaining

## Development Workflow

1. **Pick a story** from the current phase
2. **Create a branch** named `story/[story-number]-[brief-description]`
3. **Implement** following the tasks and acceptance criteria
4. **Test** thoroughly with unit and integration tests
5. **Document** any new functionality or changes
6. **Review** code with team members
7. **Merge** when all criteria are met

## Tracking Progress

Update story status as you work:
- 📝 **Not Started**: Story not yet begun
- 🚧 **In Progress**: Currently being worked on
- 👀 **In Review**: Code complete, awaiting review
- ✅ **Done**: All criteria met and merged
- ❌ **Blocked**: Cannot proceed due to dependency

## Dependencies

Key dependencies between stories:
- Phase 2 depends on Phase 1 completion
- Phase 3 depends on Phase 2 agents
- Phase 4 can start with partial Phase 2
- Phase 5 can start with Phase 3

## Success Metrics

- **Development Velocity**: Stories completed per day
- **Quality**: Test coverage and bug count
- **Performance**: Meeting speed requirements
- **Usability**: User feedback scores
