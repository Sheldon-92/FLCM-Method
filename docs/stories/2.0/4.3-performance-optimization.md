## Dev Notes

### Technical Design
```typescript
// Performance monitoring interface
interface PerformanceMonitor {
  metrics: PerformanceMetrics;
  profiler: SystemProfiler;
  benchmarks: BenchmarkRunner;
  alerts: AlertSystem;
  
  startMonitoring(): void;
  collectMetrics(): PerformanceReport;
  runBenchmarks(): BenchmarkResults;
  detectBottlenecks(): BottleneckReport[];
}

// Performance optimization strategies
interface OptimizationStrategy {
  name: string;
  target: OptimizationTarget;
  implementation: OptimizationImplementation;
  
  analyze(): PerformanceAnalysis;
  optimize(): OptimizationResult;
  validate(): ValidationResult;
}
```

### Performance Targets
```yaml
performance_targets:
  response_times:
    api_calls: < 500ms
    file_operations: < 100ms
    workflow_steps: < 2000ms
    ui_interactions: < 200ms
  resource_usage:
    memory: < 512MB base
    cpu: < 30% average
    disk_io: < 50MB/s peak
    network: < 10MB/s average
  throughput:
    concurrent_workflows: 10+
    api_requests_per_minute: 100+
    file_operations_per_second: 50+
```

### Optimization Techniques
1. **Caching**: Multi-level caching for API responses and file data
2. **Lazy Loading**: Load resources only when needed
3. **Connection Pooling**: Reuse network connections
4. **Compression**: Compress data in transit and at rest
5. **Async Operations**: Non-blocking I/O operations
6. **Memory Management**: Efficient object lifecycle management

## Testing Requirements
- Performance benchmarks for all major operations
- Memory leak detection automated tests
- Load testing for concurrent operations
- Regression testing for performance metrics

## Definition of Done
- [x] All acceptance criteria met
- [x] Performance monitoring operational
- [x] Memory optimization complete
