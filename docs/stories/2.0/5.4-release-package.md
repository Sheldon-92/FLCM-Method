## Dev Notes

### Technical Design
```typescript
// Release management system
interface ReleaseManager {
  builder: ReleaseBuildManager;
  versioning: VersionManager;
  distributor: ReleaseDistributor;
  validator: ReleaseValidator;
  
  buildRelease(version: Version): Promise<ReleaseBuild>;
  publishRelease(release: ReleaseBuild): Promise<PublishResult>;
  validateRelease(release: ReleaseBuild): Promise<ValidationResult>;
  rollbackRelease(version: Version): Promise<RollbackResult>;
}

// Release configuration
interface ReleaseConfig {
  version: SemanticVersion;
  channels: DistributionChannel[];
  platforms: Platform[];
  artifacts: ReleaseArtifact[];
  validation: ValidationConfig;
}
```

### Release Pipeline
```yaml
release_pipeline:
  build_stage:
    - code_compilation
    - asset_bundling
    - dependency_resolution
    - artifact_generation
  test_stage:
    - unit_tests
    - integration_tests
    - smoke_tests
    - security_scans
  package_stage:
    - platform_packages
    - installer_creation
    - documentation_bundling
    - signature_signing
  publish_stage:
    - github_releases
    - npm_publishing
    - package_managers
    - cdn_distribution
  validation_stage:
    - deployment_tests
    - health_checks
    - rollback_readiness
    - monitoring_setup
```

### Distribution Channels
1. **GitHub Releases**: Primary release hosting with assets
2. **npm Registry**: Node.js package distribution
3. **Package Managers**: Homebrew, Chocolatey, Snap, etc.
4. **Direct Download**: CDN-hosted installation packages
5. **Container Registries**: Docker and OCI container images

## Testing Requirements
- Release build automation testing
- Cross-platform package validation
- Distribution channel integration testing
- Rollback procedure validation

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Release build pipeline operational
- [ ] Version management system working
- [ ] Distribution channels configured
- [ ] Release documentation automated
- [ ] Validation and rollback procedures established
