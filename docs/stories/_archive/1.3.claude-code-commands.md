## Dev Notes

### Command Structure from Architecture (docs/architecture/api-specification.md):
```typescript
// Command Router Definition
interface FLCMCommands {
  // System Commands
  '/flcm:init': () => Promise<void>;
  '/flcm:help': () => Promise<string>;
  '/flcm:status': () => Promise<SystemStatus>;
  
  // Agent Invocation (to be added in later stories)
  '/flcm:collect': (input: CollectInput) => Promise<ContentBrief>;
  '/flcm:scholar': (brief: ContentBrief) => Promise<KnowledgeSynthesis>;
  '/flcm:create': (synthesis: KnowledgeSynthesis) => Promise<ContentDraft>;
  '/flcm:adapt': (draft: ContentDraft) => Promise<PlatformAdaptation[]>;
  
  // Workflow Commands (to be added in later stories)
  '/flcm:quick': (input: string) => Promise<PublishPackage>;
  '/flcm:standard': (input: string) => Promise<PublishPackage>;
}
```

### BMAD Command Pattern Reference:
The `.claude/commands/` structure in BMAD uses:
- Individual command files for each command
- Shared command utilities
- Consistent error handling
- Command registration system

Example BMAD command structure to follow:
```
.claude/
└── commands/
    ├── flcm-init.ts
    ├── flcm-help.ts
    ├── flcm-status.ts
    └── utils/
        ├── command-router.ts
        └── error-handler.ts
```

### Error Message Guidelines:
- Be specific about what went wrong
- Suggest concrete next steps
- Include relevant command usage
- Reference documentation when helpful

Example:
```
❌ Configuration file not found
💡 Run '/flcm:init' to create the initial configuration
📚 See docs/setup.md for configuration details
```

### Command Aliases Configuration:
Store in `.flcm-core/data/command-aliases.yaml`:
```yaml
aliases:
  fc: flcm
  quick: "flcm:quick"
  help: "flcm:help"
  "?": "flcm:help"
```

### Testing
**Testing Framework:** Use Jest for unit tests (following BMAD pattern)
**Test File Location:** `.flcm-core/tests/commands/`

**Unit Tests:**
- Test each command individually with Jest
- Mock file system operations for init command
- Test command router with various inputs
- Verify error handler returns correct format

**Integration Tests:**
- Verify autocomplete suggestions work in Claude Code
- Test error scenarios with invalid inputs
- Check command history persistence across sessions
- Validate alias resolution with different formats

**Manual Tests:**
- Run `/flcm:init` and verify directory creation
- Run `/flcm:help` and confirm all commands listed
- Run `/flcm:status` and check output format
- Test command aliases (e.g., `/fc:help`)
- Verify error messages are helpful
