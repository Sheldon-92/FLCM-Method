11. **Semantic Linking** (2.5): ML-based connection discovery
12. **Daily Summaries** (2.6): Automated learning consolidation

## Dependencies and Risks

### Technical Dependencies
- Obsidian Plugin API compatibility
- Transformer models for embeddings (Story 2.5)
- D3.js for graph visualization (Story 2.2)
- Vector database for similarity search (Story 2.5)

### Implementation Risks
- Migration complexity for existing users
- Performance overhead of dual architecture
- Obsidian API changes
- Embedding model size and performance

## Recommendations

### Implementation Order
1. Start with Story 1.1 (Dual Architecture) as foundation
2. Implement Story 1.2 (Schema Migration) for data compatibility
3. Build Story 1.3 (Framework Library) for core functionality
4. Develop Stories 2.1-2.6 in parallel for Obsidian features
5. Complete with Stories 1.4-1.6 for polish and monitoring

### Success Metrics
- 100% backward compatibility maintained
- <5% performance overhead
- >80% user adoption of 2.0 features within 3 months
- Zero data loss during migration
- >90% accuracy in semantic linking suggestions

## Conclusion
All 12 stories for FLCM 2.0 have been successfully created with comprehensive technical details, clear acceptance criteria, and implementation guidance. The stories provide a complete blueprint for migrating from FLCM 1.0 to 2.0 while maintaining backward compatibility and adding significant new capabilities through Obsidian integration.
