# **Introduction**

This document outlines the complete full-stack architecture for FLCM (Friction Lab Content Maker), deeply inspired by and borrowing from BMAD's proven architectural patterns. FLCM adapts BMAD's methodology-driven, YAML-based agent architecture for the domain of AI-assisted content creation, learning enhancement, and multi-platform publishing.

The architecture leverages BMAD's successful patterns including:
- **YAML-driven agent definitions** for flexible, configurable AI personas
- **Executable task workflows** that guide users through complex processes
- **Template-based document generation** for consistent output
- **Methodology engines** that embed thinking tools into the system
- **Command-based interaction** through Claude Code

This unified approach ensures that FLCM inherits BMAD's robustness while extending it with content-specific capabilities for collection, learning, creation, and adaptation across multiple platforms.

## **Starter Template or Existing Project**

**Base Architecture:** BMAD Core v4.41.0
- Leveraging existing BMAD infrastructure patterns
- Adapting agent/task/template system for content domain
- Maintaining compatibility with Claude Code command system
- Extending with content-specific methodologies and workflows
