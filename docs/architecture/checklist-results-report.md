## **Key Architectural Decisions**

1. **BMAD Architecture Adoption**: Leveraging proven patterns reduces development risk and provides mature foundation
2. **Local-First Approach**: Ensures privacy, speed, and user ownership of content
3. **Methodology Transparency**: Every thinking tool is visible and explainable to users
4. **Document-Driven State**: Concrete artifacts at each stage provide certainty
5. **Obsidian Integration**: Enables long-term knowledge compounding

## **Next Steps**

1. **Implementation Phase 1**: Set up core infrastructure (.flcm-core structure)
2. **Agent Development**: Create YAML definitions for all four agents
3. **Methodology Library**: Implement core thinking tools
4. **Command Integration**: Build Claude Code commands
5. **Testing Framework**: Establish validation workflows
